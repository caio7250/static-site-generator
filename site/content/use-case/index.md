# Use Case: Developer Portal Launch

[< Back Home](/)

## Scenario

A platform team needs a public developer portal for new API partners. The content includes quick starts, authentication steps, and integration guides, and it needs to stay up to date without shipping code.

## Why this generator fits

- Markdown-only content changes for faster updates
- Single template keeps the layout consistent across all guides
- Static output deploys to any CDN or object storage

## Suggested structure

1. Home page with the integration overview
2. Getting started guide with auth and environment setup
3. API reference pages organized by resource
4. Release notes for versioning changes

## Expected impact

A lightweight portal with predictable performance and no runtime dependencies. Updates are simple and the site scales cleanly as the API surface grows.
